Gordon's Kitchen Makeovers


Gordon's are known for being specialists in kitchen makeovers, they can refurbish almost any kitchen!
For approximately half the price of what it would cost to fully fit, they can refurbish by providing new doors,
worktops, drawers, cornices, pelmets, plinths, sinks, taps etc.
It doesnâ€™t even matter if the sizes are odd or non-standard as they make everything made to measure,
and typically it only takes 1-2 days to complete a makeover.
